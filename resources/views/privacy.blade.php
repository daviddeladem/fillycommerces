            <p>By using this site, you have consented to our Privacy Policy and that you have the legal capacity to give
                consent. Otherwise, you may discontinue and log out at this stage.</p>
            <h5 class="my-4">2. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
            <p>We collect personally identifiable information (including but not limited to email address, name, phone
                number, physical address, location, photo, banking details (when you make purchases), online identifiers,
                etc.) from you when you set up a free account with Filly Commerce. While you can browse some sections of our
                site without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require
                registration. We do use your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your
                interests. The information and personal data are as freely provided by you to us using any technology at the
                material time.</p>
            <h5 class="my-4">3. Use of Demographic and Profile Data</h5>
            <p>We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal
                information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal
                information to resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service; collect fees owed;
                measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers,
                products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and
                other criminal activity; enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise described to you at the time of
                collection. In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyse
                demographic and profile data about our users' activity on our website. We identify and use your IP address
                to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is also used to
                help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. We will occasionally ask you to complete
                optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information (like
                location, local government area, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our
                site, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in--and to display content according
                to your preferences.</p>
            <h5 class="my-4">4. Cookies</h5>
            <p>We use cookies to collect information. A "cookie" is a small piece of information stored by a Web server on a
                Web browser so it can be later read back from that browser. Cookies are useful for enabling the browser to
                remember information specific to a given user. Filly Commerce places both permanent and temporary cookies in
                your computer's hard drive. Filly Commerce's cookies do not contain any of your personally identifiable
                information or private data. We use technology in collecting information in order to make our Sites and
                other content or services which we make available to you more interesting and useful to you. For instance,
                when you come to one of our Sites via your computer or other media device, we may combine your visitor
                session information or other information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technical methods
                with personally identifiable information in order to understand and improve your online experiences and to
                determine what products, promotions, and services you prefer or are likely to be of interest to you.
            </p>
            <h5 class="my-4">5. Governing Principles of Data Processing</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Your personal data on Filly Commerce shall be collected and processed in accordance with legitimate and
                    lawful purpose consented to by you herein, provided that further processing may be done only for
                    archiving,
                    scientific research, historical research, or statistical purposes for public interest in line with
                    extant
                    regulations and laws.</li>
                <li>Personal data shall be adequate, accurate and without prejudice to the dignity of the human person:</li>
                <li>Personal data shall be stored only for the period within which it is reasonably needed, and shall be
                    secured
                    against all foreseeable hazards and breaches such as theft, cyberattack, viral attack, dissemination,
                    manipulations of any kind, damage by rain, fire or exposure to other natural elements.</li>
                <li>Our data collection shall depict that we owe a duty of care to you.</li>
                <li>We shall be accountable in line with extant laws and regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="my-4">6. Sharing of personal information</h5>
            <p>We may share personal information with our other corporate entities and affiliates to help detect and prevent
                identity theft, fraud, and other potentially illegal acts; correlate related or multiple accounts to prevent
                abuse of our services, and facilitate joint or co-branded services that you request where such services are
                provided by more than one corporate entity. Those entities and affiliates may not market to you as a result
                of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-in. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by
                law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to respond to subpoenas, court
                orders, or another legal process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement offices,
                third-party rights owners, third-party vendors, contractors, and suppliers who perform services for us or on
                our behalf and require access to such information to do that service, or others in the good faith belief
                that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that
                an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights,
                property or personal safety of our users or the general public. Filly Commerce and its affiliates will share
                some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we (or our assets) plan to
                merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a transaction occur, other business entity
                (or the new combined entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal
                information.</p>
            <h5 class="my-4">7. Personal Date Retention Period</h5>
            <p>Filly Commerce will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set
                out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                accounting or other legal requirements.) Upon request for account closure, your account will be closed but
                this closure will not involve deletion of historical records of the account for the reasons already stated.
                However, except as may be required by law or law enforcement agents and/or regulators, further processing of
                the personal information related to the account will cease from time of closure.</p>
            <h5 class="my-4">8. Your Privacy Rights</h5>
            <p>In certain circumstances, you may object to the processing of your personal information or request to delete
                already inputted personal data. To make this request take the following simple steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Send an email to Filly Commerce</li>
                <li>Title your email delete my personal data</li>
                <li>We will act upon your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>With that, it is as simple as done.</p>
            <h5 class="my-4">9. Links to Other Sites</h5>
            <p>Our site links to other websites that may collect personally identifiable information about you. Filly
                Commerce is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those linked websites.</p>
            <h5 class="my-4">10. Security Precautions</h5>
            <p>Our site has stringent security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the
                information under our control. Whenever you change or access your account information, we offer the use of a
                secure server. Once your information is in our possession we adhere to strict security guidelines,
                protecting it against unauthorized access. However, please bear in mind that we cannot guarantee that the
                internet in itself is 100% secure and so we cannot take responsibility for the illegal acts of hackers as
                long as we have taken the necessary precautions. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
                information, transmission of personal information to and from our services is at your own risk. You should
                only access our site or services through and within a secure environment. Most importantly, you are
                responsible for keeping your User ID and password secure and you should not disclose them to anyone.</p>
            <h5 class="my-4">11. Choice/Opt-Out</h5>
            <p>
                Filly Commerce provides all users with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving non-essential (promotional,
                marketing-related) communications from us on behalf of our partners, and from us in general, after setting
                up an account. If you can remove your contact information from all Filly Commerce lists and newsletters. In
                the future, you can unsubscribe by clicking the one-click unsubscribe button located at the bottom of every

            <p>

                number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
                services of interest to you.
            </p>
            <h5 class="my-4">13. Remedies, Questions and Contact</h5>
            <p>
